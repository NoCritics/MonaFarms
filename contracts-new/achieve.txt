AS STATED in CONT-DEF.TXT FOR NOW WE ONLY NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE TIER RANGES (NUMBER OF REQUIRED PTS) AS WELL AS FARM UPGRADES WITHOUT THE ACHIEVEMENTS THEMSELVES, AS THESE ARE PLANNED FOR THE LATEST STAGE OF THE DEVELOPMENT. DUE TO THAT, QUIRCKY AND SEASONAL TIERS TURN INTO LEGENDARY AND EPOCHAL (CHANGE IN NAMES AND SCOPE), ONCE EPOCHAL IS COMPLETE - PLAYER RECEIVES A 2ND PLATINUM COSMETIC EMBLEM SAYING "DIVINE <player's nickname>, THE ASCENDED FARMER". SO NOW ITS BEGINNER-INTERMEDIATE-EXPERT-MASTER-LEGENDARY-EPOCHAL. LEGENDARY = 6001-10000, EPOCHAL = 10001-20000. BOTH EMBLEMS SHOULD BE PERMANENT ELEMENTS ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE PLAYER.
